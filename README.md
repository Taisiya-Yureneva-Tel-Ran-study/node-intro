### Loto numbers generator.
There are two solutions - one was suggested by the Copilot, and it looks really nice, so I could not resist.
The other one is my solution, it might stuck a little if it's not used as a loto generator but, for example, as a shuffler. But I think it should not go to an infinite loop.
